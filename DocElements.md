Visual Studio Code: 
    Setting python.languageserver 
        => Pylance finds cv2 definitions, matplotlib, immvision, but has failed once one immvision.figure / first launch (works after) 
        => Jedi finds everything, incl matplotlib,  cv2, immvision. Does not find cv2 stubs

        Visual Studio Code uses Pylance by default
